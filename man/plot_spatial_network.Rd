\title{Plot PANORAMIC spatial colocalization network}
\usage{
plot_spatial_network(net_result, layout = "fr", node_size_by = "degree")
}
\arguments{
\item{net_result}{A list returned by \code{create_spatial_network()},
containing at least a graph element (an igraph object)
and summary statistics such as n_clusters and modularity.}

\item{layout}{Character string specifying the graph layout passed to
ggraph (e.g. "fr", "kk", "stress"). Default "fr".}

\item{node_size_by}{Character name of a vertex attribute used to scale
node sizes (e.g. "degree", "strength", "betweenness").
Default "degree".}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the network plot.
}
\description{
Visualize the spatial colocalization network constructed by
\code{create_spatial_network()} using ggraph and tidygraph.
Nodes represent cell types and edges represent significant differential
colocalization, with edge width proportional to |z| and node size
based on a chosen centrality measure.
