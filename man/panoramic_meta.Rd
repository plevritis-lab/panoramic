\title{Random-effects meta-analysis of PANORAMIC features
Perform feature-wise random-effects meta-analysis on PANORAMIC spatial
statistics, optionally estimating separate between-sample variances
(\eqn{\tau^2}) per group, which is recommended. Pooled estimates and diagnostics are written
into \code{rowData(se)}.}
\usage{
panoramic_meta(
  se,
  tau2 = c("SJ", "REML", "DL"),
  group_col = NULL,
  BPPARAM = BiocParallel::SerialParam()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} produced by
\code{panoramic_spatialstats()} or \code{panoramic()}, containing
assays \code{"yi"} (effect estimates) and \code{"vi"} (within-sample variances) for each feature (ct1, ct2, radius) and sample.}

\item{tau2}{Character. Estimator for the between-sample variance \eqn{\tau^2}. One of \code{"SJ"} (Sidik-Jonkman), \code{"REML"},
or \code{"DL"} (DerSimonian-Laird), passed to \code{metafor::rma.uni()}.}

\item{group_col}{Optional character scalar giving the name of a column
in \code{colData(se)} that defines groups (e.g. treatment) for
group-specific pooling. If \code{NULL}, a single meta-analysis is
fitted across all samples for each feature.}

\item{BPPARAM}{A \code{BiocParallelParam} object controlling
parallelization across features (rows). Defaults to
\code{BiocParallel::SerialParam()}.}
}
\value{
The input \code{SummarizedExperiment}, with additional columns appended to \code{rowData(se)}:
\itemize{
\item If \code{group_col} is \code{NULL}, columns:
\code{mu_hat}, \code{se_mu}, \code{tau2}, \code{Q}, \code{I2}, \code{k}, \code{p_mu}.
\item If \code{group_col} is provided, the same set of columns
is created per group, prefixed by a group label, e.g. \code{GroupA_mu_hat}, etc.
}
PANORAMIC meta-analysis settings are also stored in
\code{metadata(se)$panoramix$meta}.

\description{
Random-effects meta-analysis of PANORAMIC features
Perform feature-wise random-effects meta-analysis on PANORAMIC spatial
statistics, optionally estimating separate between-sample variances
(\eqn{\tau^2}) per group, which is recommended. Pooled estimates and diagnostics are written
into \code{rowData(se)}.
}
\details{
For each feature (cell-type pair and radius), the function fits a
univariate random-effects model via \code{metafor::rma.uni()}, using
the supplied \code{yi} and \code{vi} across samples. Features with
fewer than 2 finite observations (and positive variances) receive
\code{NA} for all meta-analytic quantities.

When \code{group_col} is supplied, separate random-effects models are
fitted within each group level, producing group-specific pooled
effects and heterogeneity statistics. This supports differential
colocalization analysis across biological conditions.

\dontrun{
# Global pooling
se_meta <- panoramic_meta(se)

# Group-specific pooling by treatment
se_meta <- panoramic_meta(se, group_col = "group")
