\usage{
plot_volcano(
  se_diff,
  fdr_threshold = 0.05,
  effect_threshold = 5,
  label_top = NULL,
  title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se_diff}{A SummarizedExperiment returned by
\code{pano_compare_groups()}, where rowData(se_diff) contains at least
ct1, ct2, beta_diff, p_diff, and fdr_diff.}

\item{fdr_threshold}{Numeric scalar. FDR threshold used to define
significance for highlighting and labeling. Default is 0.05.}

\item{effect_threshold}{Numeric scalar. Absolute effect size threshold
|beta| used to highlight strong effects. Default is 5.}

\item{label_top}{Optional integer. If non-NULL, only the top
label_top pairs (smallest p_diff) among FDR-significant
features are labeled. If NULL (default), all FDR-significant
pairs are labeled.}

\item{title}{Optional character string for a custom plot title. If
NULL, a title is constructed from metadata(se_diff)$panoramic
if available.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the volcano plot.
}
\description{
Create a volcano plot summarizing differential spatial colocalization
results from PANORAMIC. Points represent cell-type pairs, with the
x-axis showing effect sizes and the y-axis showing -log10(p)
from \code{p_diff}. Significant pairs can be highlighted and labeled.
